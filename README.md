# Automata AMD SEV-SNP Attestation SDK
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview
Automata AMD SEV-SNP Attestation SDK is the most-feature complete SDK for AMD SEV-SNP development, it consists of two parts:

* SEV-SNP library: it helps developers to generate the AMD SEV-SNP Attestation Report in different cloud service providers (CSP).
* Risc0 and Succinct ZK host and guest programs to interact with the corresponding zkVM servers to generate the proofs, and constructs the [Automata AMD SEV-SNP Attestation](https://explorer-testnet.ata.network/address/0xDe510E1F9258c94c5520B717210a301Cc8297F1F) contract calls to perform the on-chain verification.

### Environment Preparation
Refer to [SEV-SNP](./sev-snp/README.md) to setup the AMD SEV-SNP CVM in different cloud service providers (CSP).

## AMD SEV-SNP Attestation Generation
Use [SEV-SNP](./sev-snp/README.md#generate-attestation) to generate the AMD SEV-SNP Attestation Report with VEK Cert, you can find an example in [sev_snp_attestation](./sev-snp/examples/attestation.rs).

## AMD SEV-SNP Attestation Verification
Combining the Attestation Generation and the ZK Optimization, you can generate an either Risc0 or SP1 ZK proof with the AMD SEV-SNP Attestation Report and the VEK Cert output, and verify it via [verifyAndAttestWithZKProof](https://explorer-testnet.ata.network:443/address/0xDe510E1F9258c94c5520B717210a301Cc8297F1F?tab=read_contract#57859ce0) method.

```solidity
/**
 * @param output the zkVM output.
 * @param zkCoprocessor 1 - RiscZero, 2 - Succinct.
 * @param proofBytes the zk proof.
*/
function verifyAndAttestWithZKProof(
    bytes calldata output,
    ZkCoProcessorType zkCoprocessor,
    bytes calldata proofBytes
)
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Why are there BabyBear and BN254 Program IDs?**
>
> SP1 program identifiers (vkeys) exist in two representations to serve different purposes in the zero-knowledge proof workflow:
>
> - **BN254 Representation** (`vkey.bytes32_raw()`): This is the on-chain program identifier used for proof verification. The BN254 elliptic curve field is required for on-chain Groth16/Plonk proof verification, making this the canonical identifier for smart contract interactions.
>
> - **BabyBear Representation** (`vkey.hash_u32()`): This is the off-chain program identifier used by zkVM explorers, proof aggregation systems, and development tooling. The BabyBear field is native to SP1's internal arithmetic, making it more efficient for off-chain operations and proof composition.
>
> **Important Note on Endianness:** The BabyBear values shown in the deployment table above are big-endian (BE) encoded within each 4-byte word for human readability and cross-tool compatibility. The SP1 zkVM internally uses little-endian (LE) encoding of the same BabyBear representation for computation.
>
> When integrating with this SDK:
> - Use the **BN254 representation** when configuring on-chain verifiers or calling verification contracts
> - Use the **BabyBear representation** when querying zkVM explorers or composing proofs

### ZK Optimization

#### Risc0
To get started, you need to have the following installed:

* [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
* [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
* [RISC Zero](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/install)

##### Configuring Boundless

With the Boundless proving network, you can produce a [Groth16 SNARK proof] that is verifiable on-chain.
You can get started by setting the following environment variables:

```bash
export BOUNDLESS_RPC_URL="https://..."  # Boundless network RPC endpoint
export BOUNDLESS_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."    # Your wallet private key (hex-encoded)
export PINATA_JWT="..."                  # Pinata JWT for IPFS storage (for ELF uploads)
```

For more information, see the [Boundless documentation](https://docs.boundless.network/developers/quick-start).

#### Succinct
To get started, you need to have the following installed:

* [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
* [SP1](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/getting-started/install)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

***Note:*** *SP1 5.2 includes mainnet support by default. To request a whitelisted address for the SP1 production network, [complete the form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-X9uH7G0bvXH_kjptnQtNil8L4dumrVPpFE4t8Ci1XT1GaQ/viewform).*

With the SP1 Proving Network, you can produce a [Groth16 SNARK proof] or [Plonk SNARK proof] that is verifiable on-chain.
You can get started by setting the following environment variables with your whitelisted address:

```bash
export SP1_PROVER=network
export SP1_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."  # Your whitelisted private key
# SP1_RPC_URL is optional - SP1 5.2 defaults to production mainnet endpoint
```
